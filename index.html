        <p>Hi! My name is Demaria and I'm a second year Computer Science major. I love learning and I'm interested in Web Development because I want to be able to create websites that are informative and useful. I have some experience with web development as I have created some websites before and I hope through this course I will be able to garner a greater understanding of the fundamentals and then apply them in a way that elevates the websites I create. To start my journey of Web Development, I am learning bit by bit, like adding this image of a building below: </p>
